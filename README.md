# Design-Patterns
The goal of this project is to design three GasPump components using a Model-Driven
Architecture (MDA). An executable meta-model, referred to as MDA- EFSM, of GasPump
components should capture the “generic behavior” of all three GasPump components and should be
de-coupled from data and implementation details. In addition, in the Model-Driven Architecture
coupling between components should be minimized and cohesion of components should be
maximized (components with high cohesion and low coupling between components).

There are three GasPump components:
* GasPump-1
* GasPump-2
* GasPump-3.

The design makes use of the following patterns:
* State pattern
* Strategy pattern
* Abstract factory pattern
